      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>we believe in connecting farmers and their
        communities. We want to provide families with the
        freshest produce straight from the soil with the
        convenience that our society has come to expect.
        We hope that you feel as passionate as we do about sourcing
        local and we look forward to developing a long lasting
        relationship with you!

        Sincerely,

        The team at Harvest
